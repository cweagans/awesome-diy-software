title: Awesome DIY Software

# awesome-diy-software

A curated list of awesome DIY software. Inspired by [awesome-go](https://github.com/avelino/awesome-go) and [this HN post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16591918).

What awesome-diy-software has in common:

-   Describe a technology or feature by implementation.
-   Ideally in no more than few thousands lines of code (and not just 10-20 line code snippets).
-   Idea is to teach about underlying technology by a hands-on project, which is not overwhelming like trying to implement full-feature game engine and yet captures the essence of technology.
-   All have the "Weekend Projects" feel
